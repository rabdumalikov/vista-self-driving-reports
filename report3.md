# Progress:

* Here I used `/current_velocity.twist.angular.z` for **yaw_rate** and `/current_velocity.twist.linear.x` for **speed**.
In the video below you can see that with such ground truth the agent was able to stay on the road longest, but some part of road shape was wrong.

* Vista guys still didn't comment on my issue.
* I still playing around with hyperparameters. I did it manually, but better to automate hyperparameter tuning with grid search.
* Manual driving is possible.
* Controlling quality is also possible.

# Problems:
* No 

# Plan:

* Finish script for automate hyperparameter tuning.
* Find out how vista calculate depth of an image.
